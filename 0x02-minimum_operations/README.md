# Minimum Operations

## Description
This project is designed to solve the problem of calculating the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a target number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The solution involves understanding and applying several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts, including dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, and greedy algorithms.

## Concepts and Resources
### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming helps break down the problem into simpler subproblems and build up the solution.

### Prime Factorization
Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

### Code Optimization
Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective is useful in finding the most efficient solution.

### Greedy Algorithms
The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.

### Basic Python Programming
Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
