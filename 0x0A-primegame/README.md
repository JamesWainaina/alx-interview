### Overview
In this project, you will leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

### Concepts Needed

#### Prime Numbers
- Understanding the definition and properties of prime numbers.
- Implementing efficient algorithms to identify prime numbers within a range.

#### Sieve of Eratosthenes
- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.

#### Game Theory
- Basic principles of competitive games, including turn-based play and optimal strategies.
- Understanding win conditions and strategies to secure a win.

#### Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- Utilizing previous results to expedite future calculations, which may be crucial for optimizing the solution across multiple game rounds.

#### Python Programming
- Utilizing loops and conditional statements to implement game logic and algorithms.
- Managing arrays and lists to store integers and track removed numbers.
