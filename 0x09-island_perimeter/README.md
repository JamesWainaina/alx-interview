# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Overview
This project, "0. Island Perimeter," challenges you to calculate the perimeter of a single island within a grid, represented by a 2D array of integers. The task requires a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures (particularly matrices or 2D lists), and conditional logic to solve a geometric problem in a grid context.

### Problem Description
To complete the "0. Island Perimeter" project, you will utilize your skills in navigating and analyzing 2D arrays, applying logical conditions, and counting relevant features. The goal is to determine the perimeter of an island within a grid by counting the number of land edges exposed to water.

## Key Concepts

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and Iterating**: Learn to access and iterate over elements in a 2D array.
- **Navigating Adjacent Cells**: Understand how to navigate through adjacent cells both horizontally and vertically.

### Conditional Logic
- **Perimeter Calculation**: Determine whether a cell contributes to the island's perimeter by checking its surroundings.

### Counting Techniques
- **Edge Counting**: Develop a method for counting the edges that form the perimeter of the island.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Task Breakdown**: Approach the problem by breaking it into manageable tasks, such as identifying land cells and determining their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to iterate over the grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements**: Implement conditional logic to assess the status of adjacent cells.
