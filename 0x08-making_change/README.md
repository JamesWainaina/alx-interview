# 0x08. Making Change

## Overview

This project focuses on solving the classic **coin change problem** using algorithms, specifically exploring both **dynamic programming** and **greedy algorithms**. The objective is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make up a specific total amount, given a list of coin denominations. The project is part of the curriculum to solidify understanding of algorithms, problem-solving strategies, and Python programming.
